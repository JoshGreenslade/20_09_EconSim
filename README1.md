# 20_09_EconSim

A free market fantasy economy simulator based on [this excellent article](https://github.com/JoshGreenslade/20_09_EconSim/blob/master/008_Emergent_Economies_for_Role_Playing_Game.pdf) written by Jonathon Doran and Ian Parberry.

Heavily borrows from the excellent [BazzarBot](https://github.com/larsiusprime/bazaarBot)

# How to run.

Clone the repository and run econsim.py.

You'll find the agent rules inside files in the AgentTypes folder.

I promise to come back and tidy this up eventually = )
